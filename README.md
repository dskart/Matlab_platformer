Welcome to my Matlab Game !
I made a platformer a while back in matlab and thought some people might want to play with it.
The story line is based on the class this project was for so don't try to understand it too much.

Just just run the CLICKTOPLAY.m script and you are set to go !

Keep in mind that this was one of my first coding projects.

The script will run a platformer "engine" I made in matlab, check out the MyGame.m function in the functions folder if you want to learn more about how it works. You could use that function to load your own levels and make your own game but I am not maintaining this so you might need to tweak some stuff.
